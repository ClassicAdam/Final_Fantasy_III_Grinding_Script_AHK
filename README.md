# Final_Fantasy_III_Grinding_Script_AHK
This AutoHotKey script will automate grinding in Final Fantasy III (3D remake) for PC.

The script is for the 3D remake of Final Fantasy III made for the PC, and not other versions:

This script requires AutoHotKey to be installed to run:

The autobattle feature must be enabled in the game.  The script primarily just makes your party run back and forth to get into battles.  Once the battle starts, the autobattle needs to do the actual battle.  Once it finishes, the script will use the "Enter" key to get by a few screens and return to running your party back and forth.

The script has a variable to change how many times it will loop.  By default, it's set to loop 100 times.

Thank you and enjoy!
